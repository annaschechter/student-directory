Student Directory
=================
The student directory is a part of Makers Academy pre-course material and also my first coding project. It is written in Ruby and uses the command line as an interface. 

The student directory script allows users to manage the list of students enrolled on the course at Makers Academy.

How to use
----------
Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:annaschechter/student-directory.git
```

Load the file
```shell
$ ruby directory.rb
```
